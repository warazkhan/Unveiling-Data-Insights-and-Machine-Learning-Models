# Unveiling Data Insights and Machine Learning Models

The project involved an unlabeled dataset consisting of various features, including numerical, categorical, and date-time variables, along with a binary target variable having values of 0 or 1. The dataset is unlabeled to prevent bias towards its features and relies solely on model performance and feature importance. The primary objective was to develop a predictive model for a classification problem to accurately classify the target variable based on the input features.
